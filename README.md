 Created 3 HTML webpage for custom travel trips where user will be able to customize the trip based on his preferences.

The main HTML page (travel.html) have nabber with buttons that change the color when they are hovered.

Login button redirect the user to separate Login page where when the login button is selected the button change the color and have some transition.

Contact button redirect the user to form.html page.
In this page user can fillet his information and from dropdown button chose  for how many people he wants to make request for reservation.

The main page (travel.html) include also:

when user click above Hero image there is a transition animation  where the background gets darker and text appear above the image. Also image gets surrounded by red border.
in the header section of the page there is a Gif animation “hello” that welcome the user.
in the nav bar is included also search form with search button.
when the user scroll down he/she will find dropdown button with options from that he/she can select.
right under the dropdown button there is a table with the hours of operations (hours of the guided trips and there locations}
at the bottom there is a footer with additional information and links that can be added.




While created the pages I also used different HTML tags, different text, CSS selectors,  CSS animations, flex box and Bootstrap grid.
